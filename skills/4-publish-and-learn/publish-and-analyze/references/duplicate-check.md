# Duplicate check before scheduling

Instagram holds a reel that "looks like something you shared before". It compares
the picture against everything the account has posted, not only a reel's siblings,
and not the caption, timing or upload route. Hook variants that share one body are
the usual victims. Check every video before it is scheduled, and again after a re-edit.

## Run it

```bash
python3 scripts/dupe_check.py compare <candidate.mp4> <earlier-post.mp4|https-url> [...]
python3 scripts/dupe_check.py batch manifest.json --out report.json
```

- **References:** every earlier post on each destination account, published or
  queued, including reels posted natively in the app, which a scheduler may not list.
  At minimum, the siblings and the last few weeks. Post media URLs work directly;
  fingerprints are cached in `~/.cache/dupe-check`.
- **Batch manifest:** `{"posts": [{"key", "media", "at", "group", "outcome"}]}`; each
  post is scored against every post before it.
- **Needs:** Python 3, FFmpeg, `numpy`, `scipy` and `pdqhash` (Meta's open-source PDQ hash).

## Read the result

| Verdict | Video match | Action |
|---|---|---|
| LIKELY CLEAR | < 0.10 | Schedule |
| BORDERLINE | 0.10–0.55 | Barely tested; fix it before posting |
| LIKELY HELD | ≥ 0.55 | Don't schedule. Re-edit, then check again |

Video match is the share of the candidate's frames with a near-identical frame (PDQ
distance ≤ 31) anywhere in a reference. Audio is reported but doesn't set the
verdict: audio-only changes didn't prevent a hold, and a reel with a changed picture
passed with the same audio. The checker errs toward caution; it predicts, it isn't
the platform's matcher.

## Fix a flagged variant

The treatment that cleared and scored 0.00 transforms the **whole composited frame**:
a punch-in of about 8%, anchored slightly high so faces and captions stay in frame;
a changed grade (warmer or cooler, saturation and contrast a few percent); and a new
cover. A punch-in on the camera layer alone leaves captions and graphics identical
and still scored borderline. Give each variant a different amount, anchor and grade
so they also clear each other. Speed or pitch changes alone are not a fix. Work from
the master, rerun the delivery checks and this check, and record the recipe.

**The punch-in has a ceiling.** Tall phones already crop a 9:16 video's sides (a
20:9 phone shows about x 108..972 of 1080), and a punch-in pushes everything outward:
a point at x lands at 540 − (540 − x) × zoom. Keep the outermost text, captions and
cards inside x 108..972 after the zoom, and check the treated file the way
`edit-video` describes for tall phones.

When the layout leaves no room, as motion graphics with text near the margins
usually do, rebuild the variant instead of cropping it: shrink the whole foreground
toward a point inside the frame (for example to 93% for one variant and to 90%
toward a different point for another) over a full-bleed background, give it its own
side margins and grade, and render again. Shrink the whole foreground, presenter and
all; resizing only the cards leaves the big shapes identical and still scored
borderline. Rebuilt this way, variants scored 0.00 against the original and each
other with every line on screen, where the same edits with punch-ins went out with
text cut off on an iPhone.
